	abstract = {A large number of advanced ﬁnite element shell formulations have been developed, but their adoption is hindered by complexities of transforming mathematical formulations into computer code. Furthermore, it is often not straightforward to adapt existing implementations to emerging frontier problems in thin structural mechanics including nonlinear material behaviour, complex microstructures, multi-physical couplings, or active materials. We show that by using a high-level mathematical modelling strategy and automatic code generation tools, a wide range of advanced plate and shell ﬁnite element models can be generated easily and efﬁciently, including: the linear and non-linear geometrically exact Naghdi shell models, the Marguerre-von Kármán shallow shell model, and the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. To solve shear and membrane-locking issues, we use: a novel re-interpretation of the Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Component (MITC) procedure as a mixed-hybridisable ﬁnite element method, and a high polynomial order Partial Selective Reduced Integration (PSRI) method. The effectiveness of these approaches and the ease of writing solvers is illustrated through a large set of veriﬁcation tests and demo codes, collected in an open-source library, FEniCS-Shells, that extends the FEniCS Project ﬁnite element problem solving environment.},
